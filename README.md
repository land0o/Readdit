# Readdit
Backend capstone a book forum  web application built with asp .net core mvc. 
Readdit is my Back-end Capstone built with C#, SQL, Identity framework and the Goodreads API. I came up with the idea after a long search on Reddit trying to find new books to read, Reddit topics devolve very quickly. So Readdit is a fully functional forum website were users can have disscusions about books they've read and plan to read, as well as save the books they've read and a wishlist of books to their profile.  

How to run this app

Clone the project and install all dependencies using the command line:

git clone git@github.com:land0o/Readdit.git

To open the app in visual studio use the command line:

start Readdit.sln

If you want to use this app in another project you will need to Create/register the app with Goodreads, see below.
Create/register the app here https://www.goodreads.com/api/keys after you register your app you will get your own unique API keys, replace the keys in the Secret.json file.
